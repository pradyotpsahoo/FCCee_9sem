Higgs-strahlung $e^{+} + e^{-}\longrightarrow Z+H$ is the most important mechanisms for the production of Higgs bosons in  $e^{+} + e^{-}$ collisions at $LEP$ and future $e^{+} + e^{-}$ linear colliders. We have calculated the different kinematic parameters such as transverse momentum, rapidity, pseudorapidity, etc. of the Higgs and Z boson using $PYTHIA$ event generator.
When the Z boson decays into $e^{+}e^{-}$ or $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$,
we have calculated the angle between the daughter particles and also reconstruct the mass of the $Z$ boson from the daughter particle.
At last, we have calculated the angle between $Z$ and $Higgs$ in this which comes out to $\pi$ for conserving momentum.
