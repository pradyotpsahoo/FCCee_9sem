We will generate the signal with background samples and apply fast parametric detector simulation with Delphes in the EDM4Hep format, then  analysis it as we have done in this project. We will also study the different kinematics of Higgs boson and its daughter particles. Later we will study the tracking efficiency  and jet energy resolution of the detector.
