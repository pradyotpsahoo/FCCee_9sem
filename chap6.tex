We  have reconstructed  the mass of $Z$ boson from  $e^{+}e^{-}$, $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$   in decay of $Z$ which satisfies invariant mass law  and also studied different kinematic parameter as shown in previous section.
The analysis performed by  running  a fast parametric detector simulation with Delphes in the EDM4Hep format. Then 
we have 
applied  an event selection on our delphes sample with FCCAnalyses
and  produced flat ntuples with observables of interest with FCCAnalyses.
By analysing the  ntuple  produced with ROOT's RDataFrame
and  used  the  ROOT's  TTree  class  to  store  the  data  in  a  tree  structure  and  then  used  the  ROOT's  TCanvas  class  to  plot  the  data  in  a  graph  format.
